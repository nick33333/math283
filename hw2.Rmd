This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```
```{r}
k=c(-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6)
prob = dpois(x=k, lambda=2.4)
cumprob = ppois(q=k, lambda=2.4)

data = matrix(c(as.integer(k),prob,cumprob), ncol=3)
colnames(data) = c('k', 'P(X=k)', 'F(X<=k)')
print(data)
```

```{r}
ds = seq(0, 1, length.out=100)

recomb <- function(d) { # create a function with the name my_function
  return ((1-exp(-2*d))/2)
}

term1 <- function(d) {
  return (d)
}

recomb(d=ds)

plot(ds, recomb(d=ds),type = "l", col = "blue", main="H-203 (d. ii.) Plot",
  xlab="Distance (Morgans)", ylab="Recombination Rate",)
lines(ds, ds, col='orange')
legend("bottomright", legend = c("r = (1-exp(-2d))/2", "r = d"), col = c("blue", "orange"), lty = 1)

```
```{r}
k = c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6)
cross_freqs = c(53,73,48,22,3,1, 0)
crossovers = k*cross_freqs
sum(cross_freqs)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
